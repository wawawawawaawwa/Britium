// FakeLag Fix - handles shooting fakelagging enemies
// Strategy: Instead of just waiting for unchoke (which gives enemies free movement time),
// we predict where they actually are using their velocity and choke duration,
// then set tick_count to target the server's known position.
//
// How fakelag works on the server:
// - Enemy chokes N ticks → server stores all N commands
// - When enemy unchokes, server processes all stored commands at once
// - Server's lag compensation knows the enemy's REAL position at any tick
// - Our client only sees the last update (stale position during choke)
//
// How we counter it:
// - Detect choke by checking simtime gaps (simtime - oldSimtime > 1 tick)
// - Predict where the enemy actually is using their last known velocity
// - Set tick_count to the enemy's real simulation time (which the server knows)
// - This works because the server backtracks to whatever tick_count we send
